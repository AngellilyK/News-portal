            <h2>TOUR DU MONT BLANC BASICS</h2>
            <p>Before we dive into what a classic Tour du Mont Blanc itinerary looks like, let's first get through some basics of the tour. That will better help you understand the tour and how you would like to tweak it to fit your preferences. The Tour du Mont Blanc, or the TMB, is a long distance hiking trail that circumnavigates the Mont Blanc Massif. In a classic itinerary of the TMB, you pass through 3 countries, France, Switzerland and Italy, and is approximately 110 miles in length. Although most people with good physical health can undertake the trek, it is still a challenging trek. There is over 6 miles of both elevation gain and loss. People that attempt the tour by themselves should have previous experience in Alpine conditions and be comfortable using a compass and map.  </p>
            <h3>Where is Mont Blanc?</h3>
            <p>It depends if one is asking about the highest point of the mountain or the entire massif (i.e. mountain range). The summit of Mont Blanc lies on the border of Italy and France. An 1860 act signed by Napoleon III places Mont Blanc squarely on the border of both countries. The administration and responsibility for the mountain is shared largely between Courmayeur, Italy and Chamonix, France. Both villages have a rich history of mountaineering on Mont Blanc and are iconic spots in and of themselves.</p>
            <p>If one is referring to the Mont Blanc Massif, the inclusion of Switzerland should be considered. The massif is 46 kilometers long (28.75 miles) and extends from Val Montjoie, containing the town of Les Contamines, France to its northeastern section located in the Val Ferret of Switzerland. At it's widest point, it extends 20 km (12.5 miles). The Tour du Mont Blanc is a trek that circumnavigates the entire Massif. The total hiking distance is 170 km or 110 miles</p>
            <h3>How do you get to Mont Blanc?</h3>
            <p>Most international travelers arrive into Geneva airport in Switzerland and take either a train or shuttle to Chamonix in France. There are a few popular places to begin the tour including Chamonix, Les Houches, Courmayeur and Champex. The classic route starts in Les Houches and travels counter clockwise. </p>
            <h3>Is Mont Blanc the tallest mountain in Europe?</h3>
            <p>There is some debate on whether Mont Blanc is the tallest mountain in Europe. The summit's elevation is 4,808.73 metres (15,776.7 ft). It is the highest point that is west of the Caucasus. The Caucasus straddle Europe and Asia. Central to the debate is where one places the geographic border between Asia and Europe. The majority of authorities place the continental boundary of Europe and Asia at the Caucasus watershed, although this is not universally accepted. That would mean that Mount Elbrus, at 5,621 meters (18,442 ft), is the highest mountain in Europe. If you consider the Kuma-Manych Depression as the border, then Mont Blanc is considered the tallest mountain in Europe. In either case, Mont Blanc is tall.</p>
            <h3>Weather on Tour du Mont Blanc</h3>
            <p>As you will be traveling from around 3,200 feet to 8,800 feet in elevation, you will experience several different temperatures and weather systems. During the summer months, it does snow on rare occasions, leaving a layer of snow on the ground that doesn't dissipate for a day or two, sometimes longer. On the flip side, the valleys can be 80 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit. Layering is important to adapt to the changes of weather.</p>
            <h3>The complexity of the route</h3>
            <p>The route is undulating, with a good degree of elevation change. As you are making your way around the Mont Blanc Massif, you cross over several saddles, or cols - the lowest pass in between two peaks. The elevation of the hike stays roughly between 3,200 feet and 8,800 feet, not high enough to cause altitude sickness. During the early part of the season, Alpine conditions will be more prevalent and snow can be found at the higher elevations and cols. Crampons may be necessary, or you one may need to take lower route alternatives to avoid snowy sections. In a few places, ladders and metal stairs have been placed into the rock, for example, in between Tre Le Champ and Refuge le Flegere. However, there is an alternative route that goes around this section. Additionally, there are few sections of exposure that those with vertigo may find a bit unnerving.</p>

            <p>I have been on many camping trips in different countries. I have about 5 years' experience in this. One day I read on the internet about the Tour du Mont Blanc, one of the most popular hiking trails in Europe. I saw the pictures of the route and immediately decided that this is where I would be going in the near future. Just the chance came up, not to miss such an event</p>
