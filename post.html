            <h2>Choosing Alpine ski resorts correctly</h2>
            <p>A number of factors influence the choice of a suitable ski resort in the Alps, such as the altitude differences in the ski area. The likelihood of good snow cover is higher if the lowest skiing point is at an altitude of 1,500 metres. Bear in mind, however, that higher altitude can be a challenge for untrained skiers, as the temperature drops as the altitude increases. Strong winds can also make skiing difficult.</p>
            <p>For a beginner, sometimes 1 learning slope is enough. For professionals and extreme skiers, red slopes and black slopes are more suitable. However, all types of holidaymakers should pay attention not to the number of ski runs, but to the coherence of the ski areas, as a ski resort does not always consist of 1 mountain that has slopes. It often consists of several nearby mountains and peaks, between which it is necessary to travel by ski-bus.</p>
            <h3 class="post-page-subheadings quote">The Alps lie in eight countries: France, Monaco, Italy, Switzerland, Germany, Austria, Liechtenstein and Slovenia.</h3>
            <h3 class="post-page-subheadings">Ski village</h3>
            <p>As a rule, a ski village is a small town. Alpine villages are often located in the valley at the foot of the mountains. The resort is formed on the basis of real towns with local people, history and a special atmosphere. The main type of accommodation in the Alpine villages are hotels or chalets. Much of the infrastructure is owned by locals. The hotels are built in the Alpine style. The owners often live near the guests, bringing a special homelike atmosphere to the service.</p>
            <p>Products in restaurants and stores in alpine villages are usually locally produced, and the cooking is done by local chefs. The cuisine in restaurants is more homemade, authentic with local flavor. And vacationing in such towns is a pleasure. The infrastructure of the Alpine villages is formed historically. They grew up gradually, without any special plans. Skiing areas in them are mostly small. There are practically no apartments and hotels in the ski-in/ski-out format, which suggest skiing on the doorstep or just at the exit of the hotel.</p>
            <h3 class="post-page-subheadings">Ski station</h3>
            <p>A ski station is a type of resort, the complete opposite of an alpine village. They are usually located high on the mountain or mountain plateau. Ski stations are created according to a single plan by investor companies. At the same time first appears skiing area, and then around it built multi-storey complexes to accommodate tourists. Turnkey apartments are offered without meals and additional cleaning services. Infrastructure of the ski stations is planned and thought out. Everything is aimed at comfortable skiing. Different systems of modern ski elevators, ski-in/ski-out hotels, big and beautiful ski areas are the main advantages of the ski resorts.</p>
            <p>The disadvantage of this type is the lack of an authentic alpine atmosphere. As a rule, ski stations are dominated by apartments rather than hotels. Servicing apartments is cheaper, and staff is usually hired seasonally. Apartments offered at ski station complexes can be very comfortable and multi-roomed. And the price of accommodation is much lower than in private hotels and apartments in ski villages and mountain resorts. The quality of service depends directly on the pricing policy of the institution. In high-level restaurants the cuisine can be exquisite and expensive. But restaurants with democratic prices and standardized European menu prevail. The ski station in the Alps is the best option for choosing an economical vacation, an active, unabusive skiing on the slopes of any difficulty, or learning to ski for beginners.</p>
            <h3 class="post-page-subheadings">Mountain resort</h3>
            <p>A mountain resort is something between an alpine village and a ski station. A mountain resort can be located either in a valley or in the mountains. A distinctive feature of this type is year-round operation. Mountain resorts offer a wide range of accommodation. Some of them may be owned by global hotel chains, some by investor groups, and some by local owners. Hotels and apartments in mountain resorts also operate in the summer, offering different types of vacations for tourists.</p>
            <p>The advantage of a mountain resort is that the economy of the infrastructure is spread throughout the year. This makes it possible to maintain a pricing policy for accommodation without a big difference between high and low season prices.</p>

            <p>Just recently visited the Alps. I chose the ski resort of Lech, which is located on the border of Austria and Germany. A peculiar microclimate, ensuring a perfect snow cover throughout the season, the highest level of service of comfortable hotels and the entire ski infrastructure will please even the most spoiled tourists.</p>
